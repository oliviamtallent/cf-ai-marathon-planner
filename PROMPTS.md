# Prompt List Given to CHATGPT: GPT-5.2

## General Guidance
My idea is to make a chatbot where a user submits a marathon date, time goal,
and previous training level, and the AI outputs a day-by-day training plan.
Is this acceptable for the Cloudflare AI assignment?

What does Cloudflare mean by "workflow / coordination" in the assignment?

## AI Prompt Engineering and JSON Enforcement
Can you show me an example JSON schema for a day-by-day marathon training plan?

The AI output is being truncated and not closing the JSON.
How should I chunk generation safely?

## Error Handling and Debugging
Why am I getting "Unexpected token 'I' ... Internal Server Error" when parsing JSON?

Why does console.log not show when running inside a Cloudflare Worker?

## UI Management
How can I manage a variable to show or hide parts of the UI from JavaScript functions?

Why does my loading text become NaN when updating during recursive calls?

## Documentation and Submission Preparation
What should I include in README.md for a Cloudflare intern AI project?

How should I acknowledge that I bootstrapped from a vanilla chat template?

How do I structure PROMPTS.md to comply with the application rules?
